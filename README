A new approach for the edge detection is presented using the fuzzy derivative and the evolutionary learning techniques such as bacterial foraging, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm and gravitational search algorithm. If-then rules are devised for calculating the derivatives in the possible directions about the pixel of interest to find the edge pixels in an image. These rules have been devised to ensure that the variation of intensity due to noise is discarded.  Median of the derivative set is taken to obtain derivative matrix which is fuzzified using the bell-shaped membership function. Another membership function HIGH, acting as hedge, is used to locate the edges in the fuzzified image. The fuzzy entropy involved in the objective function and parameters that control the shape and range of the membership functions are optimized using different evolutionary algorithms. The final edge map is obtained by subjecting the fuzzified image to the adaptive thresholding. Quantitative analysis of the feasibility of the proposed approach and its comparison with other standard edge detection operators available in the literature in terms of kappa value and entropy measurement is given.
